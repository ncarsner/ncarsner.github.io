# TIL

At one job, we had a number of channels in our messaging application. Some for our working groups, some for the devs, some for the QA folks. One of my favorites was `TIL` which was the chat forum equivalent of <i>"I was today years old when..."</i> that precluded stories about discovering functionality in a programming langauge, or touched on useful scripts or flags, or discoveries about overlooked process gaps, or publisher updates. Whatever the source, it was always interesting to see my teammates discovered and shared with the rest of us.

Some examples:
- I learned one day that Git Bash could split a large file with a number of lines argument.
```bash
split file_name -l 1000
```

This was useful to our QA testers. As we were all running Windows machines, it typically resulted in trying to manually divide CSV files, which was impractical for very large data sets or orders of magnitude required to fully test rich sections of code.

One day, I posted in the channel that I had finally discovered a real-world use for the quadratic equation. It didn't generate immediate buzz, but a few hours later, one of our IT Managers responded with _"okay, I'll bite..."_

Firstly, do we all remember the quadration equation?

$$\text{x} = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$$

<!-- 
The growth pattern described follows a **quadratic (polynomial)** relationship, specifically represented by the triangular number sequence.

This can also be expressed as the combination formula: C(n,2) = n!/(2!(n-2)!)

## Growth Type
- **Quadratic growth** (O(n²))
- Not exponential (would be 2^n, 3^n, etc.)
- Not logarithmic (would grow very slowly)
- Not linear (would be n, 2n, etc.)
- Not compound interest (exponential with continuous compounding)

The differences between consecutive terms (2, 3, 4, 5...) increase linearly, which is the hallmark of quadratic growth. The second derivative is constant.

I had been researching node points and network relationships, discerning how to calculate the number of 1:1 connections that existed in an organization _(or network)_ with `n` personnel. For two people, there is one connection. For three people, there are three connections, shaped like a triangle. For four people, there are six connections. Each additional point expands the number of relationships by the previous `n` value.

$$\text{Relationships} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} => \frac{n^2 - n}{2}$$

Here's how it scales:

| People (n) | Connections (c) |
|------------|---------------|
| 2          | 1             |
| 3          | 3             |
| 4          | 6             |
| 5          | 10            |
| 10         | 45            |
| 20         | 190           |
| 50         | 1,225         |
| 100        | 4,950         |

<!-- 
This section discusses the polynomial growth of relationships within an organization.
It introduces a variable 'p' representing the number of people in an organization and 
hints at a mathematical calculation to determine the number of relationships based on 
organization size. This appears to be leading into an explanation of combinatorial 
relationships or network theory as applied to organizational structure.
-->
The number of relationships grows quadratically as the size of the organization increases. For an organization of `n` people, I suspected there was a calculation that existed that could inversely determine the the number of node points _(people)_ that existed given `c` connections. Turns out, the quadratic equation provides the answer.

<!-- ## Solving for Node Points Given Connections -->

Starting with our relationship formula:
$$c = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}$$

Multiply both sides by 2:
$$2c = n(n-1)$$

Expand:
$$2c = n^2 - n$$

Rearrange to standard quadratic form:
$$n^2 - n - 2c = 0$$

Apply the equation where $a=1$, $b=-1$, and $c=-2c$:
$$n = \frac{-(-1) \pm \sqrt{(-1)^2-4(1)(-2c)}}{2(1)}$$

Simplify:
$$n = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{1+8c}}{2}$$

Since a positive result is expected, a positive root is used:
$$n = \frac{1 + \sqrt{1+8c}}{2}$$

### Solve 10 Connections
---
$$n = \frac{1 + \sqrt{1+8(\color{lightgreen}{10}})}{2} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{81}}{2} = \frac{1 + 9}{2} = 5$$

**Answer:**
- 10 connections = 5 people

### Solve 200 Connections
---
$$n = \frac{1 + \sqrt{1+8(\color{lightgreen}{200}})}{2} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{1601}}{2} = \frac{1 + 40.01}{2} \approx 20.5$$

**Answer:**
-  200 connections = ~20-21 people

Everybody loves a math lesson, but what is the takeaway? For security specialists, it might be accounting for components of an attack surface for network protocols. For testing analysts, it can help to determine the number of scenarios to create and analyze for integrated systems. For managers, it can help to understand how many sidebar conversations are occurring around an organizational mandate.

If you were <i>today years old</i> when you discovered a practical use for the quadratic equation too, I hope you have a channel in which to share it.
