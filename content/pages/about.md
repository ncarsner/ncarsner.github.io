Hi, I'm Nicholas. I work in data analysis, data engineering, and process automation, with a rich history of healthcare claims and big data. I also engage in data science and attempt to share here what I have learned. Data-driven decision making is my appreciation language.

## Background

I'm passionate about transforming raw data into actionable insights that drive meaningful business decisions. With extensive experience in healthcare analytics, I've helped organizations optimize processes, reduce costs, implement and streamline automation, and improve outcomes through data-driven strategies.

## What I Do

Beyond technical work, I enjoy mentoring, collaboration, sharing knowledge about data best practices, and empowering others to implement best practices in a natural way. When I'm not analyzing datasets or building pipelines, you might find me exploring new technologies or contributing to the data community.
